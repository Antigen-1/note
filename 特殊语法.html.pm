◊h1{特殊语法}

◊h2{形式上的定从}

◊p{在逻辑上相当于状从或并列句。}

eg.[NCE4.1]◊b{We can read of things that happened 5000 years ago in the Near East,where(because) people first learned to write (there).}

◊(br)

造句：最近几年大批农民工（migrant workers from the countryside）涌入大城市，◊b{因为}他们◊b{在那里}可以找到不错的工作并且养活家人。

◊(br)

The past few years witnessed the great ◊i{influx} of migrant workers from the countryside to big cities,where they could ◊i{secure decent jobs} and ◊i{support} their families.

◊h2{不定式作表语}

◊p{不定式作表语若前面出现了实义动词“do”，则常去掉“to”，例如：}

◊lst{
ul
All I have to ◊b{do} is ◊b{dream}.
The best thing you can ◊b{do} now is ◊b{write} her an apology.
}

◊h2{定语从句省略}

◊p{定语从句关系代词作主语后跟be动词，二者可一同省略。例如NCE4.1}

◊lst{
ul
the first people who were similar to ...
the first people similar to ...
}

◊h2{(even) if引导让步状从}

例如◊b{He is seldom, if ever, absent from work.他——即使有也很少——旷工。}

◊h2{语气}

表推测：

◊lst{
ul
may/might have done
must have done
cannot/could not have done
}

表批评（虚拟）：

◊lst{
ul
should/ought to have done
should not/ought not to have done
}

◊h2{不定式作主语}

◊b{sth be ◊i{adj} to do=to do sth be ◊i{adj}}

◊p{此处do为及物动词}

◊h2{虚拟语气}

◊;;TODO

◊p{对现在虚拟：◊i{If S were/did ..., S would/should/could/might do ...}}

◊p{例如◊i{Were it not for your support, I would be in big trouble now.}}

◊p{在此例句中，除虚拟语气外，还出现了其倒装形式。}

◊p{◊i{if it were not for ...}表示”若没有...的话“，因此可以译为“若没有你的支持，想必我现在已经麻烦大了罢。”}

◊h2{并列句省略}

◊p{并列句中重复部分除动词搭配的介词外，只要不引起歧义均可省略。}

◊lst{
ul
Paul likes poetry, and Peter (likes) fiction.
Paul likes poetry, and I know that Peter likes fiction.
}
